in the moment before the car
there was that feeling, the one i always felt
and didn't fell, i felt myself feeling
the sky was so blue
everyone dressed their wholesomest, cheering, rejoycing
we didn't die that day

i'm an ironic millenial transsexial from manhattan
i'm not supposed to feel suprised not to die
in a combat setting in the south
i'm not constitutionally set up for it

anyway, i was feeling some kind of a way then, in that moment
they call it solidarity
but it was the eternal solidarity, the ur-solidarity,
the once and future solidarity of
woodprints graffitis revolutions and dumpsters
the moment just held everything

i don't know why the blueness of the sky sticks out so much
it's like God loved us
